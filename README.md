## Part 1 Terraform bootcamp

### Chapter 1 Getting started with Terraform

[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) is a provisioning and management tool for
infrastructure layer based on IaC, or [infrastructure as a code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code).

Not Cloud in particular but almost any provider that allowed resource control over
API, or [application programming interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API).

Terraform is not a _configuration management_ tool as [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/)
or [SaltStack](https://saltproject.io/) ans as such.

Basic principle of Terraform is to operate infrastructure in immutable way, via
configuration defined using human readable syntax, and allowed to make
those configurations repeatable, consistent, vendor independent.

Terraform not operate as a deployment solution, it allocates and defines
infrastructure via vendor delivered resources.

Terraform configurations written in a domain-specific configuration language — HCL,
or [HashiCorp configuration language](https://github.com/hashicorp/hcl/blob/main/hclsyntax/spec.md).

Configurations written in HCL can be converted 1:1 to JSON, YAML, TOML and
similar formats.

The engine of Terraform called Terraform core and it's free, open-source software
offered under [Mozilla Public License v2.0](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/MPL/2.0/).

> Another example of HCL usage, — configuration files for [vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/).

HCL is a declarative, so that configurations express desired result and not
gave exact instruction how to achieve it.

Terraform is cloud-agnostic, means that it uses the same approach to run on any
desired vendor, despite their API peculiarities.

The only limitation is to have right _Terraform provider_ (plugin) for desired vendor, which can be found in [Terraform registry](https://registry.terraform.io/browse/providers).
Those providers are written in [Go](https://go.dev/) language and distributed in
a binary form.

Providers take care of authentication, making API requests and handle errors.

> Author suggests to use AWS as a playground.

> Terraform needed to be [installed](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli#install-terraform).

Plan for Hello Terraform:

1. Write Terraform configuration file.
2. Configure AWS provider.
3. Initialize Terraform with `terraform init`.
4. Deploy the [EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/)
   (Elastic Compute Cloud) instance with `terraform apply`.
5. Clean up with `terraform destroy`.

> All original book's code can be found on a [github](https://github.com/terraform-in-action/manning-code).

Terraform reads `.tf`'s config files as a guide to provisioning
infrastructure.

Author suggest to create `main.tf` configuration file, that can be found by
`p01/ch01/sub0102/main.tf` path of this repo. This configuration operates resources for Frankfurt region.

Defined resource prefixed with keyword `resource`, followed by the provider specific
resource type in a double quotes, and given resource name in the double quotes also.
Resources can be anything, that vendor suggested: virtual machines, load balancers,
gateways, and so forth.
Then, in the curly braces the configuration given.

`instance_type` specifies certain resource identifier provided by vendor.
Note, that not every resource identifier varies between different regions.

> Available regions for AWS could be found by this link: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_enable-regions.html?icmpid=docs_iam_console#id_credentials_region-endpoints

> AWS EC2, region dependent, instance types could be found by this link: https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/home?region=us-east-1#InstanceTypes:
>
> Change the value of `region=` query parameter to compare, or find proper one.

> For example, N. Virginia location offers smallest instance `t1.micro`, where
> Frankfurt only `t2.nano`.

> Pay attention to `Free-Tier eligible` if you intended to just play around.
>
> e.g.: `t2.micro` EC2 instance type.

`ami` specifies certain AWS image to be deployed on top of chosen instance.
It is id assigned by AWS an it needs to be chosen regarding requested instance
type's architecture, CPU and memory availability.

> AMI ID is a vendor/region specific value.

> Complete list of AMIs can be found by this link: https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/home?region=us-east-1#Images:visibility=public-images

`tags` user-defined identifiers in a Key=Value manner.

Each resources has inputs, or arguments, and outputs, called attributes. There
are also computes attributes, which only available after resource has been created.

Provider / region isolation should be defined in a `provider` section.
Providers do not have outputs.

By invoking **`terraform init`** command in a shell, in the folder with configuration
file, terraform will discover required providers, and will try to download them
from registry.

By the end of initialization, terraform will produce lock artifacts, which will
be considered as a version lock and defines starting point for the workspace.

Nothing will be deployed, yet.

To deploy new configuration to the vendor, we need to invoke another shell command
**`terraform apply`**.

> In case no credentials were provided, terraform will output an `Error` message,
> stating, that `no valid credential source for Terraform AWS Provider found`.

Each vendor may suggest it's own way to store and manage credentials.

> AWS way to manage it's credentials could be found by this link: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html
>
> Basically it can be manage this way: create text file by this path
> `~/.aws/credentials` regarding your OS, with this contents
>
> ```
> [default]
> aws_access_key_id=
> aws_secret_access_key=
> ```

After setting up credentials, **`terraform apply`** can be invoked once again.

Terraform application will output information about upcoming action,
execution plan, and wait for enter **`yes`** keyword as a agreement to this plan.

After that, it'll create requested resources.

> Note, that that process might take some time to accomplish, so Terraform will
> sequentially inform about elapsed time.

Terraform will finalize execution with result info, what was changed
in what quantity.

> You can observe applied changes in a AWS management console: https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/home?region=us-east-1#Instances:visibility=owned-by-me

Current state will be written in a `.tfstate` file.

**`terraform show`** will printout current state in a HCL format.

To maintain last command of full cycle and freed resources invoke
**`terraform destroy`** command.
It will produce similar information about upcoming action, execution plan as _`apply`_ command, but minuses signs (-) will identify negative operation over previously allocated resources.
As in apply command, destroy will force you to commit on sanity check, and
confirm action with `yes` keyword.

After that, it'll destroy previously allocated resources.

And, the same way as on creation, Terraform will inform about result of operation.

`terraform show` can be invoked to confirm that state was actualized.
