## Part 1 Terraform bootcamp

### Chapter 1 Getting started with Terraform

[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) is a provisioning and management tool for infrastructure layer based on IaC, 
or [infrastructure as a code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code).

Not Cloud in particular, but almost any provider that allowed resource control over API, 
or [application programming interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API).

Terraform is not a _configuration management_ tool as [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) 
or [SaltStack](https://saltproject.io/) and as such, but a tool that performs certain API calls to chosen resources, 
to preserve desired resource state.

The Basic principle of Terraform is to operate infrastructure in an immutable way, via configuration defined 
using a human-readable form, and allowed to make those configurations repeatable, consistent, vendor independent.

Terraform not operate as a deployment solution, it allocates and defines infrastructure via vendor delivered resources.

Terraform configurations written in a domain-specific configuration language — HCL, 
or [HashiCorp configuration language](https://github.com/hashicorp/hcl/blob/main/hclsyntax/spec.md).

Configurations written in HCL can be converted 1:1 to JSON, YAML, TOML and similar formats.

> Another example of HCL usage, — configuration files for [HasiCorp Packer](https://developer.hashicorp.com/packer). 
> But Packer syntax differs from terraform. 

The engine of Terraform called Terraform core, and its free, open-source software offered under 
[Mozilla Public License v2.0](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/MPL/2.0/).

HCL is a declarative, so that configurations express a desired result and not give exact instruction how to achieve it.

Terraform is cloud-agnostic, means that it uses the same approach to run on any desired vendor, despite their 
API peculiarities.

The only limitation is to have right _Terraform provider_ (plugin) for the desired vendor, which can be found 
in [Terraform registry](https://registry.terraform.io/browse/providers).
Those providers are written in [Go](https://go.dev/) language and distributed in a binary form.

Providers take care of authentication, making API requests and handle errors.

> Author suggests using AWS as a playground.

Terraform cli required 
to be [installed](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli#install-terraform).

**Plan for Hello Terraform exercise:**

1. Write Terraform configuration file.
2. Configure AWS provider.
3. Initialize Terraform with `terraform init`.
4. Deploy the [EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/)
   (Elastic Compute Cloud) instance with `terraform apply`.
5. Clean up with `terraform destroy`.

> All original book's code can be found on a [GitHub](https://github.com/terraform-in-action/manning-code).

Terraform reads `.tf`'s config files as a guide to provisioning
infrastructure.

#### Configuration

Author suggests to create `main.tf` configuration file, similar configuration file can be found 
by [`p01/ch01/sub0102/main.tf`](p01/ch01/sub0102/main.tf) path of this repo.
This configuration operates resources for the Frankfurt region of AWS.

Defined resource prefixed with keyword `resource`, followed by the provider-specific resource type in a double quotes, 
and given resource name in the double quotes also.
Then, in the curly braces the configuration given.

`instance_type` specifies certain resource identifier provided by vendor.
> _Note_ that not every resource identifier varies between different regions.
>
> This link can find available regions for AWS: 
> https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_enable-regions.html?icmpid=docs_iam_console#id_credentials_region-endpoints
>
> AWS EC2, region dependent, instance types could be found by this link: 
> https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/home?region=us-east-1#InstanceTypes:
>
> Change the value of `region=` query parameter to compare, or find proper one.
>
> For instance, N. Virginia location offers smallest instance `t1.micro`, where Frankfurt starts with `t2.nano`.
>
> Pay attention to `Free-Tier eligible` if you intended to just play around.

`ami` (AWS specific property) specifies certain AWS image to be deployed on top of chosen instance.
It is id assigned by AWS, and it requires to be chosen regarding requested instance type's architecture, 
CPU and memory availability.

AMI ID is a vendor/region specific value.

> This link can find the Complete list of AMIs:
> https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/home?region=us-east-1#Images:visibility=public-images

> With Terraform, you don't need to know any specific ids of resources or other artefacts of certain provider. 
> In this case, the author uses it as a straightforward approach for configuration.

`tags` user-defined identifiers in a `Key=Value` manner.

Each resource has inputs, or arguments, and outputs, called attributes.
There are also compute attributes, which are only available after resource has been created.

Provider / region isolation should be defined in a `provider` section.
Providers don't have outputs.

#### Commands

By invoking **`terraform init`** command in a shell, in the folder with configuration file, terraform will discover 
required providers, and will try to download them from registry.

By the end of initialization, terraform will produce lock artifacts, which will be considered as a version lock 
and defines starting point for the workspace.

Nothing will be deployed yet.

To deploy new configuration to the vendor, we need to invoke another shell command **`terraform apply`**.

> In case no credentials were provided, terraform will output an `Error` message, stating, 
> that `no valid credential source for Terraform AWS Provider found`.

Each vendor may suggest its own way to store and manage credentials.

> AWS way to manage its credentials could be found by this link: 
> https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html
>
> Basically it can be manage this way: create text file by this path
> `~/.aws/credentials` regarding your OS, with this contents
>
> ```
> [default]
> aws_access_key_id=
> aws_secret_access_key=
> ```

After setting up credentials, **`terraform apply`** can be invoked once again.

Terraform application will output information about upcoming action, execution plan, 
and wait for enter **`yes`** keyword as an agreement to this plan.

After that, it'll create requested resources.

> _Note_ that that process might take some time to accomplish, so Terraform will sequentially inform about elapsed time.

Terraform will finalize execution with result info, what was changed in what quantity.

> You can observe applied changes in a AWS management console: 
> https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/home?region=us-east-1#Instances:visibility=owned-by-me

Current state will be written in a `.tfstate` file.

**`terraform show`** will printout current state in an HCL format.

To maintain last command of full cycle and freed resources invoke **`terraform destroy`** command.

It will produce similar information about upcoming action, execution plan as _`apply`_ command did, 
but minuses signs (-) will identify negative operation over previously allocated resources.

As in apply command, destroy will force you to commit on sanity check, and confirm action with `yes` keyword.

After that, it'll destroy previously allocated resources.

`terraform show` can be invoked to confirm that state was actualized.

#### Upgrade

Terraform can not only manipulate with static definitions, by known resources ids, but also dynamic using computed data.
Such data calculation behavior can be implemented by adding **`data`** source section into configuration. 
_Basically by querying them._

As an example, author suggest to evaluate latest available Ubuntu OS version, and use it's AMI id.

To do that, we need to extend previous configuration with these steps:

1. Modify Terraform configuration by adding **`data`** sources scope.
2. Redeploy with `terraform apply`.
3. Clean up with `terraform destroy`.

Data section should be prefixed with **`data`** followed by lookup resource data type and label for returned data, 
label will be referenced later. 
Both should be presented in double quotes.

Data section arguments should be wrapped around with curly braces, and they would define query constraints.

Each defined data source can be used as a reference via dot separated path, starting with **`data`** prefix, 
followed by lookup resource type, given label name, and field name that this data source will return.

This path can find example of such dynamic configuration file: [`p01/ch01/sub0103/main.tf`](p01/ch01/sub0103/main.tf).

> As, this is a standalone configuration file, that located in a different folder `terraform init` 
> required to be executed prior applying, to initialize the workspace.

Apply configuration via `terraform apply`. The output will present you with resolved lookup data id.

> In case of given example, calculated AWS `ami` by given arguments.

After applying it, `terraform show` can be invoked to check current infrastructure state.

`terraform destroy` will terminate and destroy previously acquired resources.
This command will operate by acknowledging the current state.

### Chapter 2 Life cycle of a Terraform resource

Fundamentally, Terraform is a state management tool 
that performs [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) operations on managed resources.

> Resources can be anything, there are no constraints to cloud providers, anything that follows the CRUD paradigm 
> and have access to resource API can, potentially, become a provider for terraform.

Terraform can be used not only with network resources, but also with local ones: manage plaintext files,
create private keys, issue certificates, and as such.

To maintain such local resources, special local providers can be used.

As it was mentioned, CRUD is a core concept of maintaining everything. 
Each function symbolizes a hook that terraform would perform at a certain stage of a life-cycle. 
Create on resource creation, Read on plan generation, Update on resource update, and Delete on destroy.

#### Configuration

Author suggests us to create terraform configuration to maintain plaintext file with a bit of contents.

This path can find example of such configuration file: [`p01/ch02/sub0202/main.tf`](p01/ch02/sub0202/main.tf).

To maintain local text file, `local_file` provider will do all work.
Terraform will resolve this provider reference as "hashicorp/local" by default, with the latest version.

`resource` section with specified `local_file` provider required certain arguments: `filename` and `content`.

`filename` — defines a relative path of the file with given filename.

`content` — future file contents. It uses [Heredoc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here_document) notation to define 
contents in place.

> In an HCL format such text formatting preserves POSIX shell notation (`<<-`),
> which ignores preceding tabs of each line.

> `EOF` is a wrap-around sequence where content should be placed. Heredoc doesn't intend on a specific character sequence. 
>
> _I will use a quote from Alice in wonderland as an example content._

To specify providers' dependencies in the more precise way `terraform` section can be used.
This section describes requirements and dependencies for the current configuration.

> In previous configuration samples, terraform resolves dependencies automatically from `resource` sections.

`terraform` section can specify a required terraform version constraints as a value of `required_version` argument, 
as well as providers' dependencies given in a `required_providers` subsection.

> _Note_ that some crucial configuration changes might be required regarding a major terraform version. 
> 
> Don't, really on backward capability while change from 0.x.x to 1.x.x and upper.

`required_providers` defines dependencies' constraints, as unique provider local name followed by arguments, 
`source` — name of the provider in the registry, and `version` constraint.

#### Commands

Do a `terraform init` to initialize workspace.

> `terraform init` command is idempotent, — meaning, you can call it as many times as you like, 
> and you'll get the same result unless something was changed in a configuration.
>
> Initialization creates hidden directory `.terraform` for installed plugins and modules in it.

Previously we use `terraform apply` and it gave us execution plan that we required to agree on.

You can request `terraform plan` without applying it. 

This command will test or dry run your configuration and check if it's ok.

> Defined `TF_LOG` environment variable with different [severity level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syslog) 
> will force terraform cli to log out performed steps.  

> `terraform plan` also can be invoked with `-parallelism=n` flag to enforce terraform to execute some routines 
> in-parallel within `n` given threads.

Such execution plan can be stored as a binary file artifact via `-out` flag of a command, and can be used later 
as an input argument of a `terraform apply` command or via third party tool.

> To convert it to a readable JSON form, `terraform show` command can be used supporting with `-json` flag 
> and the name of an out file, saved previously.
> 
> `terraform show - json plan.out`

Terraform creates a dependency graph as a part of building execution plan.

It can be requested an in a [DOT graphs](https://graphviz.org/doc/info/lang.html) notation form via `terraform graph`.

Dependency graph is a guideline for `terraform apply` command.

Previously saved execution plan can be applied via `terraform apply "plan.out"`.

By running this command, two files will be created, described plaintext file ('alice-in-wonderland.txt' in my example), 
and `terraform.tfstate` which will describe current state of described resources, and will be used as a start point 
to perform diffs during next `plan` execution and will detect configuration drift.

> Author warns to not edit or move/delete such files as they're crucial for terraform to track changes 
> and calculation required actions.

Terraform called `Create` function of a given provider to create file.

`Read` function will be used by terraform when next plan command will be executed. 
It will read each current resource state from `.tfstate` file to ensure that they're in a desired configuration state.

If you run it without changing the configuration, cli will tell you that `No changes` required.

Let say you update configuration file `main.tf` by adding additional line from the book Alice in Wonderland, 
— next run of `terraform plan` will tell you that to synchronise resource state with up-to-date configuration, 
it intended to add additional line that you added into configuration.

Terraform will call `Update` function on `apply` command run.
